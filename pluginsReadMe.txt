**** NOTE ****

These plugins only work for wordpress.org multisite networks.
Only network super admins are able to install the plugins.

**** NOTE ****

To install these plugins:

1. Make two folders in the wordpress/wp-content/plugins directory. One should be named Comment Tracker (or any other name you wish to use to designate the comment tracker plugin) and the other Activity View (or any other name you wish to use).

2. Place activityView.php in the Activity View folder, and commentsPlugin.php in the Comment Tracker folder.

3. Place the sharedFunctions.php, activity-class-wp-list-table.php, and comment-class-wp-list-table.php files in the root of the wordpress/wp-content/plugins folder.

4. Login as a super admin and go to the network admin dasboard.

5. Go to plugins, then installed plugins.

6. Choose Network Activate under Comments I've Made, and Activity of Links.

7. Go to the dashboard of one of your sites and you will see two new widgets at the bottom of the page, Comments I've Made and Activity of Linked Blogs. You may drag these widgets to any postion you want on your dashboard.

**** NOTE ****

Again, these plugins only work if they are network activated, as such only network super admins on wordpress multisite networks can install these plugins.
